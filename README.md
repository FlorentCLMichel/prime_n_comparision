# Comparison of Python, Rust, and Zig implementations for prime number generation

Benchmark graph that compares speed of Python, Rust, and Zig implementations of a simple prime number generation algorithm.

**Note:** The above graph is autogenerated for every github action run. Tweak the parameters in workflow run to get different graph for number of primes.

**Note 2:** The simple algorithm implemented here may not reflect performances for more efficient ones such as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

|Language|nth prime|time taken|
|---|---|---|
|rust|300000|0.924s|
|zig|300000|0.489s|
|python|300000|18.333s|
